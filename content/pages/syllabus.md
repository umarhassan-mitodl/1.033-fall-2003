## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

Recitations: 1 session / week, 1.5 hours / session

## Prerequisites

1.030, Civil Engineering Materials

## Description

This course provides an introduction to material modeling of engineering materials and structures using a unified framework of thermodynamics of irreversible processes. The subject is composed of four parts:

1. Deformation and Strain
2. Momentum Balance, Stress and Stress States
3. Elasticity and Elasticity Bounds
4. Plasticity and Yield Design

Multiple applications are discussed vis-a-vis problems in innovative Structural Engineering, Soil Mechanics, Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering. The subject develops the foundations of Mechanics and Durability of Solids. It is a pre-requisite for the Spring H-Subject 1.570 Durability Mechanics (Mechanics and Durability of Solids II), in which the same energy approach is used for Fracture and Damage Mechanics and Durability Mechanics of solids, including chemo-mechanics, poromechanics and coupled diffusion-dissolution problems.

This course is part of the Civil Engineering Mechanics Track of the undergraduate program. The subject also allows graduate students to update their knowledge in continuum mechanics and constitutive behavior and modeling of engineering materials. Graduate Students (M.Eng./Sc.M/Ph.D.) are expected to complete additional assignments.
